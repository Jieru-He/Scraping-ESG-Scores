# Scraping-ESG-Scores
In this notebook, I scrapped ESG data from Yahoo Finance to identify how sustainable companies are. To ensure the data quality, I found that the scores on the website is from Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Ratings. The rating employs a two-dimensional framework that combines an assessment of a company's exposure to industry-specific material ESG issues with an assessment of how well the company is managing those issues.

The ultimate objective of this project is to allow users to easily toggle through companies in the S&P 500 to see their ESG scores as well as create a full dataset for further analysis.
